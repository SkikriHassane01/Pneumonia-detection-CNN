# [Pneumonia Detection with CNN](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hassaneskikri/pneumia-detection)

## Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The goal is to provide an efficient, accurate, and automated diagnostic tool that assists radiologists in the early detection of pneumonia.

The project covers the full workflow of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. Detailed notebooks and scripts are included to demonstrate each step from data ingestion to final prediction.

## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
    https://github.com/SkikriHassane01/Breast-Cancer-detection.git
   ```
2. **Change directory to the project folder:**
   ```
   cd Pneumonia-detection-CNN
   ```
3. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
